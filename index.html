                <p class="animate-on-scroll">The 718 models were made for the sport of it. 
                    They are mid-engined roadsters that unite the 
                    sporting spirit of the legendary Porsche 718 with 
                    the sports car of tomorrow – and transfer it to 
                    the roads of today’s world. With one goal: to take 
                    the everyday out of every day.

                    The 718 RSK was a successor to the Porsche 550 Spyder 
                    and featured a mid-engine layout and a 1.5-liter, 
                    142-horsepower engine. The 718 was a lightweight, 
                    efficient car that was successful in races like the 
                    Targa Florio, the European Hill Climb Championship, 
                    and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

                <p class="animate-on-scroll">The Porsche 911 was first unveiled to the public on 
                    12 September 1963 when it was launched at the Frankfurt 
                    International Motor Show. Full production of the car 
                    began a year later in September 1964 at the Porsche 
                    factory in Zuffenhausen.
                    The second production model to be made by the company 
                    after the Porsche 356, interestingly the 911 was 
                    originally called the 901. However, by the time the 
                    model went on sale it had become the 911 after a claim 
                    about naming rights from French car manufacturer, 
                    Peugeot. The 911 name not only stuck but has since 
                    become synonymous with success on both road and 
                    racetrack.

                    With a sound that makes your heart beat faster. 
                    Feels and sounds close to the racetrack. With the 911 GT3, 
                    it’s not only the driving experience that gives you that 
                    authentic motorsport feeling – it’s the roar of its 
                    thoroughbred performance engine.
